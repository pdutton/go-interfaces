            Review this PR for the go-interfaces library. Focus on:

            **Architecture Patterns** (see CLAUDE.md):
            - Facade pattern: proper interface definitions and facade implementations
            - Wrapping pattern: correct use of underlying stdlib types (nub, realClient, etc.)
            - Functional options: consistent With* option naming and application

            **Go Best Practices**:
            - Error handling
            - Naming conventions
            - Proper type aliasing
            - Interface compliance

            **Testing**:
            - Unit test coverage for new interfaces
            - Test naming conventions (*_test.go)
            - Concurrent behavior tests where relevant

            **Documentation**:
            - Package-level comments
            - Interface method documentation

            Provide specific, actionable feedback with file:line references.
